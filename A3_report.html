				Insights about the data/visualization:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>The most salient part of the visual for me is that the number of new cases in Jan. 2022 noticeably exceeds that of Jan. 2021. The number of cases is increasing rapidly in Jan. 2022, compared with a slight contraction in cases in Jan. 2021.</li>
				<li>The next thing I noticed is that cases started to really swell for the first time around Nov. 2020. The case numbers start contract again in the summer of 2021 (May-Aug). It is interesting, and aligned with my 
					memory of how the pandemic played out, that the number of cases from April 2020 to Oct. 2020 was relatively smaller and stable.
				</li>
				<li>Finally, I notice some seasonal trends: the case numbers contracted in the summer of 2021, and were also small during the summer of 2020. The case numbers ballooned for the first time in the winter of 2021, and again in Jan. 2022. However, there are also some seasonal inconsistencies; notably, the case numbers ballooned in the fall of 2021, but case numbers had not yet started to pick up in the fall of 2020. The nature of the pandemic, in terms of societal response and virus variants, was very different in 2020 vs. 2021. I would expect these differences to dominate the case numbers more than the seasonal variation, so I am not suprised that the trend is not perfectly consistent when comparing months across the two years.</li>

			<h2>Final Writeup</h2>

			<p>
        DESCRIBE YOUR RATIONALE TO JUSTIFY THE DECISIONS FOR YOUR FINAL DESIGN.
				WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO CONVEY, AND HOW DOES YOUR DESIGN FACILITATE THIS?
      </p>

			<p>
        REFLECT ON HOW YOUR FINAL DESIGN DOES OR DOES NOT ADDRESS YOUR ORIGINAL CRITIQUE.
				WHAT TENSIONS OR TRADEOFFS DID YOU ENCOUNTER? WHAT DID NOT WORK OUT AS ANTICIPATED?
