				Insights about the data/visualization:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>The most salient part of the visual for me is that the number of new cases in Jan. 2022 noticeably exceeds that of Jan. 2021. The number of cases is increasing rapidly in Jan. 2022, compared with a slight contraction in cases in Jan. 2021.</li>
				<li>The next thing I noticed is that cases started to really swell for the first time around Nov. 2020. The case numbers start contract again in the summer of 2021 (May-Aug). It is interesting, and aligned with my 
					memory of how the pandemic played out, that the number of cases from April 2020 to Oct. 2020 was relatively smaller and stable.
				</li>
				<li>Finally, I notice some seasonal trends: the case numbers contracted in the summer of 2021, and were also small during the summer of 2020. The case numbers ballooned for the first time in the winter of 2021, and again in Jan. 2022. However, there are also some seasonal inconsistencies; notably, the case numbers ballooned in the fall of 2021, but case numbers had not yet started to pick up in the fall of 2020. The nature of the pandemic, in terms of societal response and virus variants, was very different in 2020 vs. 2021. I would expect these differences to dominate the case numbers more than the seasonal variation, so I am not suprised that the trend is not perfectly consistent when comparing months across the two years.</li>

				Design Critique:
			</p>

			<p>
				The two key messages of the article are that (1) the Omicron wave is forecasted to result in a large spike in cases,
				(2) it is difficult to forecast the impact of the spike, both because we don't know how dangerous the Omicron variant is, and because 
				we can't forecast the number of cases with high precision. The first point is made relatively clearly by the visualization; the spike in Jan. 2022
				is the most salient element of the visualization. The chart leverages length as a visual encoding, which is high effectiveness. Futhermore, the pop-out
				for the Jan. 2022 spike is decent (it is not pre-attentive, but it is where my eyes went to first). The size of the Jan. 2022 spike is noticeable when compared
				with the width of the line across the rest of the chart. At the time of publication, readers had lived through many spikes across several covid variants, which all 
				appear uniform when compared with the Jan. 2022 spike. This context helps the point land viscerally; you feel fear and dread about a spike that could make the spikes you 
				lived through look insignificant. I also appreciate that the visualization is quite minimal while still being expressive; the annotations are high-impact (subset of months are labeled, years with arrows, 7-day average annotation), and the simple legend gives a clear indication of what the band width represents (I am coming to realize that I love NYT legends!
				The two NYT visualizations we've critiqued so far in class both had memorably clever and minimal legends). In summary, the core message of the visualization is conveyed visually, with few high-impact text and numbers.
				<br>
				However, the second point of the article does not come across through the visualization at all. Even worse, the article consistently uses the word "cone" to describe
				uncertainty bands, while the cone in legend of this figure has nothing to do with uncertainty. We also have strong priors from typical visualizations that shaded bands
				around a solid line represent uncertainty. In this figure, the solid line has no clear meaning, so its inclusion is only distracting. I also found myself wondering what the distance of the black line to the center of the spiral represents, since the spiral is not circular. However, it does not appear to mean anything. I also think that although length, the primary visual encoding, is effective, the signal detection / magnitude estimation
				is quite difficult. This makes it difficult to interpret much from the chart reliably, other than that the spike in Jan. 2022 is larger than other spikes in the chart. If the only point we are to take away from the chart is that the spike in 
				Jan. 2022 is larger than the others, a surprising amount of space in the visualization is occupied by documenting the other months. I think some additional annotations, or re-thinking the visualization to have visual encodings that allow for easier magnitude estimation, would allow the reader to get more out of the rest of the chart (which, in theory, should give a relatively comprehensive view of the history of infection rates).
				I also think the some of the visualization choices make the figure unnecesarily hard to interpret: first, my immediate inclination is read the visualization from out to in. Second, I found it hard to detect a seasonal trend over the two years that are visualized, despite the fact that the visualization strongly implies we should look for one. Third, it takes some mental energy to determine where in time you are looking; you have to count up what month you are in, and also keep track of where the last year marker is to understand what year you are in.
